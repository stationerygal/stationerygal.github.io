	<p> Hello and welcome to my stationery blog where I give you recommendations on stationery items to use to spice up your bullet journal <br> or your everyday school/work notes!(◕ᴗ◕✿)/</p>

<h2>What is a Bullet Journal?</h2>
	<p style="color:#66ACAC">Equal parts day planner, diary, and written meditation, bullet journaling turns the chaos of coordinating your life into a streamlined system that helps you be more productive and reach your personal and professional goals. With sections to log your daily to-do’s, monthly calendar, notes, long-term wants and more, your bujo is customized to your life. (Entries are tagged with bullet points, dashes, and other graphics so you can see their categories at a glance.) </p>
	<p style="color:#66ACAC">Here are some bullet journal brands that I have found that have worked well for me:</p>

	<p style="color:#66ACAC">I am currently using the 1917 Leuchtturm A5 size, the pages do well with ink and will not bleed through the other side (depending on which pens you use though) While the Archer and Olive bullet journal is beautiful and comes with a variety of styles, though more pricier than the Leuchtturm since they are a small business.</p>
	<p style="color:#66ACAC">For beginners I would suggest starting off with the dot grid notebooks because it makes it easier to make things straight with a light guide on the pages.</p>
